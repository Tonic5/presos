# CONTENT

Problem/solution (narrative/conflict resolution)

// gist: david v goliath, good v evil, local/organic v corp $ behemoth, real v fake/processed, healthy v junk, empowered citizen v suffering "consumer"
// maybe humor? hot-or-not, or "you can get with this, or you can get with that" soundtrack?
// Amazon delivery and robots v local simplicity: SIMPLICITY. Food comes from farms. The farm-to-table movement is catching on.
But even as awareness spreads, it remains a privilege only the wealthy can access. Not just the "food deserts" in inner cities (also a problem),
even people who live near farms (eg Berkshires, 30k malnourished -- tho don't cite bc berkshire.coop sposed to be example of what's possible? TBD.

ppl who band together to form a food co-op, are facing increasing pressure and competition.
Alone: powerless. Together: network effect. 
Can't go up the street to local farmer and ask for a dozen eggs. 
Together, purchasing power of a co-op w/ standing order, makes the logistics work, ditto economies of scale.
Interface with the systems like UNFI, work can support the local farmer, the local economy, their families' health, nurture the community, and reduce the environmental impact of eating food produced thousands of miles away.
Oneota def: "local" == 100-mile radius.


// TANGENT - research about competition, industry, landscape, general bg info, etc.
